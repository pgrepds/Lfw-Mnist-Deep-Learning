# Lfw-Mnist-Deep-Learning

This repository contains code for testing some of the deeplearning features of [deepleaning4j](https://deeplearning4j.org/).
 We train various different neural network models using the [Mnist](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) and the [Lfw](http://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/lfw/)
 datasets. We have used the BaseDatasetIterators for automatically downloading the datasets, but the provided URLs are broken. The datasets must be downloaded manually as described in this issue [here](https://github.com/SkymindIO/SKIL-CE/issues/34).
